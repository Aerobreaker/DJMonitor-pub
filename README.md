### FAQ

1. What is this for?
   - When you've got to track two different julian dates, two different julian months, plus seconds after midnight, in time zones across the world, things get complicated quickly.
   - This utility aims to simplify that by tracking all of them for you, allowing you to change time zones to any zone in the IANA database (https://www.iana.org/time-zones) and allowing you to specify or modify the date/time displayed, to easily convert between values of different types or between time zones
2. Was it worth it?
   - An introduction to wxWidgets?
   - Significant speed improvements over the old python version?
   - Automatic updating of time zones?
   - Very much yes
3. Time savings?
   - Development efforts: ~100 man-hours
   - Estimated time savings: ~30 seconds, multiple times per day (4-5 man-hours per person per year)
   - Estimated break-even point: ~5 years (estimated 5 users)
   - Potential break-even point: ~1 year (potentially 20-30 users)
